## Description

The code in this repository demonstrates how to traverse a binary tree using different traversal methods: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

- `Node` class: Represents a node in a binary tree. Each node contains a value, a reference to the left child node, and a reference to the right child node.

- `in_order_traversal` function: Performs an in-order traversal of a binary tree.

- `pre_order_traversal` function: Performs a pre-order traversal of a binary tree.

- `post_order_traversal` function: Performs a post-order traversal of a binary tree.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
